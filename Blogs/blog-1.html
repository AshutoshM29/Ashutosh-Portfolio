    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>It is so easy to get stuck following tutorial after tutorial after tutorial and not making progress you'd hope you'd be making in your learning journey.</p>


    <p>You ask some people for advice on what to do next and they tell you to go build something !!</p>
        
    <p>But, what are you suppose to build ?? If you can relate to this problem then you are at thee right place!</p>
    
    <p>Remember how it was in school, boring !</p>
        
    <p>You sat in the class, cramming up as much as you could and then try to pass a test at the end. This method of learning is boring and depends on how much you can memorize things. To make the learning process fun we use project based learning.</p>
        
    <h1>What is Project Based Learning ?</h1>
        
    <p>Project Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching method in which students learn by actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects.</p>
        
    <p>Our brain has evolved to discard information that it thinks is irrelevant. Picking a problem and then using various educational tools like math, physics or economics to solve that problem is far more engaging than teaching the tools itself.</p>
        
    <h1>How to get started with Project Based Learning?</h1>
        
    <p>Here are some methods to get started with PBL :</p> 
        
    <ol>
        <li class="list-blog"><div>RENOVATE A PROJECT</div>
        Instead to making a new full project, we can save time by renovating an existing project.
        </li>
        
        <li class="list-blog"><div>DURATION OF THE PROJECT</div>
        
        The longer the project the more we can learn. Try to narrow down your priorities. Try to focus on two - three topics and based on that, aim for the duration of the project.
        </li>
        
        <li class="list-blog"><div>PLANNING</div>
        
        One of the challenging part of Project Based Learning is the planning, but it is also very enjoyable. Planning ahead of the time is very helpful. It does take take quite a bit of time but is worth it.
        </li>
        
        <li class="list-blog"><div>GATHER FEEDBACK</div>
        
        Once you have made a project take feedback on the project from your colleagues by putting it online or in person.
        </li>
        
        <li class="list-blog"><div>MAIN COURSE, NOT DESSERT</div>
        
        In traditional method of learning, student learn a(n) unit and then try to make project on it.
        On the other hand, in project based learning the project is the UNIT.
        </li>
        </ol>
        
    <h1>Are you really doing Project Based Learning?</h1>
        <p>In PBL pathway, inquiry and instructions are led by student, whereas on the other hand in traditional method inquiry and instructions are led by teachers.
        While PBL tends to cover more than one discipline and ends with a final public product. Traditional method covers one discipline and ends with a test.</p>
        

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        
        <p>PBL student performs as well or better than traditional students. Finding indicates that projects are far more superior when it comes to long term retention of skills and development. It also gives satisfaction to both students as well as teachers.</p>
        
        <p>Traditional learning approach are more effective for short-term retention as measured by standardized board exam.</p>
